## Hularion Mesh

Hularion Mesh is an ORM. Mesh enables code objects to map directly to a data store, such as a file or SQL database. It can even handle saving and retrieving generic type objects and whole self-referencing trees. For example, a business object such as a credit application could pull the application and all data associated to it from a SQL database and store it as its own file for auditing with two lines of code.
